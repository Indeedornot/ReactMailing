Client:
    ☐ Add Error handling for error responses from fetching emails
    ☐ Add signal for when emails no emails are found
    ✔ Add Error message for invalid imap data in form @done(23-02-14 19:39)
    ✔ Label for LTS checkmark and add tooltip @done(23-02-14 19:40)

Server:
    ☐ Add error handling for invalid imap data

Shared:
    ☐ Refactor expand SequenceSet to not return values that are smaller than 0 
    (maybe use a boolean to implement this as optional)
    ☐ Rethink implementation of EmailSortArgs on Shared rather than on Client
    due to being coupled with implementation of sort helper on Client
